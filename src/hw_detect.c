/*
 * hw_detect.c — 128K + Kempston detection
 *
 * 128K test: write to bank 1 at 0xC000, switch to bank 2, write a
 * different value, switch back to bank 1 and check the original value
 * survived.  On 48K the port 0x7FFD writes are ignored so 0xC000 always
 * sees the last write → detection fails.  On 128K the banks are
 * separate → detection succeeds.
 *
 * Must run before paging is locked.
 */

/* NOT contended, despite running exactly once.
 *
 * It was moved to SECTION LOGIC and then moved back: the contended window
 * is full, and the three screen painters in render_screens.c are worth
 * more per byte down there than this is.  Moving this gained ~103 bytes of
 * ceiling; leaving room for the painters gained ~800.
 *
 * Put it back if the contended window ever grows. */
