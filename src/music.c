/*
 * music.c -- the tunes, unpacked on the way in.
 *
 * Song data is the most compressible thing in this program: patterns
 * repeat and half of every row is a $01 sustain byte.  The compressed
 * blobs live below 0xC000 with the code; the unpacked data lives above
 * MEM_END, which is uncontended, is where a 128K's paging means code can
 * never go, and had 1.7 KB spare.  Worth ~430 bytes of the only region
 * that can hold code.
 *
 * ASSEMBLED AT ITS DESTINATION.  A tune's order table is a list of
 * ABSOLUTE pointers -- `DEFW PAT0, DEFW PAT1, ...` -- so compressing the
 * module's bytes and unpacking them elsewhere leaves every pointer wrong
 * by the relocation distance.  tools/gen_tritone_module.py --org
 * assembles the data at MEM_MUSIC so the pointers are correct on arrival,
 * and checks in the build that the image survives a ZX0 round trip and
 * that every order-table entry lands inside the block.
 *
 * ONE BUFFER, because only one tune plays at a time: both are blocking
 * calls from a static screen.  A second buffer would cost bytes to state
 * what the control flow already guarantees.
 *
 * The engine is shared and links once (assets/music/tritone_engine.asm);
 * only the data is per-tune.  A third tune costs its blob and nothing
 * else, provided it fits MEM_MUSIC_SIZE.
