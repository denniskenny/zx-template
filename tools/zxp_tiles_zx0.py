"""zxp_tiles_zx0.py — Convert a ZX-Paintbrush tile strip into a ZX0 header.

The .zxp holds N tiles side by side, all the same size, e.g. four 16x16
map tiles in a 64x16 sheet.  Each tile is emitted row-major (w/8 bytes per
pixel row), the tiles are concatenated in sheet order, and the whole blob
is ZX0-compressed.  The runtime decompresses it once into RAM and blits
tiles out of it with write_blit().

Colour is authored in ZX-Paintbrush alongside the art and travels with
it, PER CHARACTER CELL — a 32x32 tile carries its own 4x4 block of
attributes, not one flat colour.  The attribute block is appended to the
pixel data and the whole thing is compressed as one ZX0 stream, so the
runtime gets both from a single decompression: pixels at offset 0, tile
t's attributes at NAME_ATTR_OFF + t * NAME_ATTR_SIZE.

Two modes, because the two kinds of sheet want different things:

  --attr-mode full    (default) keep the authored byte.  Terrain uses
                      this: what the artist coloured is what appears.

  --attr-mode bright  keep only bit 6, the BRIGHT flag, and discard
                      ink and paper.  Unit sheets use this: a unit is
                      cyan or red according to whose it is, so its ink
                      is not the artist's to choose — but which cells
                      are bright still is, and that is the shading.
                      The runtime ORs the side's colour over these.

Storing bright as a whole byte per cell rather than packing it eight to
a byte costs nothing worth having: the values are 0x00 and 0x40 in long
runs, which is exactly what ZX0 eats, and it keeps the runtime a single
OR against the side colour with no unpacking.

Usage:
    python3 tools/zxp_tiles_zx0.py IN.zxp OUT.h --name NAME --tiles N
                                   [--attr-mode full|bright]
                                   [--zx0 /path/to/zx0]

In full mode, refuses attribute 0x03 (and 0x02, which becomes 0x03 when
ORed with 1): that value is the floating bus sync marker — see
.claude/skills/floating-bus-vsync.
