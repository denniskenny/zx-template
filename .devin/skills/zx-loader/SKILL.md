# ZX Loader: getting bytes to the address you asked for

`-create-app` emits **one** contiguous CODE block from `CRT_ORG_CODE`, plus
a 30-byte BASIC loader that does a single `LOAD ""CODE`. Everything else
you place — an asset blob low in memory, a cold module, a bank — needs
building into the tap yourself.

**The failure mode is always the same and always silent:** the link map is
correct, the program boots, and the data reads as zeros. This skill is
mostly about not being fooled by that.

See `.devin/skills/zx-memory` for what belongs at which address; this is
about how it gets there.

## The regions, and what each is for

| region | holds | reachable by |
|---|---|---|
| `0x6000-0x7FA0` contended | compressed assets, COLD code | everything, always |
| `0x8000-0xBFFF` uncontended | the program | everything, always |
| `0xC000-0xFFFF` | buffers, decompressed sheets, the 128K shadow screen | everything, always |
| banks 1,3,4,6 | 64 KB of storage | **128K/+3 only**, and only when paged in |

Contended RAM costs a cycle per instruction fetch, so it is right for
things read once at boot (asset blobs) or run rarely (AI, pathfinding) and
wrong for the render path. Moving ALL code there cost ~50% speed on this
project; moving one cold module cost nothing measurable.

## Emitting a block

### A standalone binary — the simplest thing that works

Assemble it on its own, never linked into the C program, so its bytes
cannot count against the code budget:

```make
$(APP)_assets_low.bin: src/assets_low.asm
	z88dk-z80asm -b -O. -o$@ src/assets_low.asm
```

```asm
    org     0x6000
_my_blob:
    defb    0xA5, 0x5A, ...
```

The C side sees only addresses. Resolve them with a `defc` module that IS
linked and costs nothing:

```asm
    MODULE  assets_low_syms
    PUBLIC  _my_blob
    defc    _my_blob = 0x6000
```

That satisfies an `extern const uint8_t my_blob[]` at zero bytes — the
same trick that removes an unwanted library font.

### A C module in its own section

```c
#pragma codeseg LOGIC
```

plus an `.asm` stub that places the section:

```asm
    SECTION COLD
    org     0x6500
```

z88dk then emits `$(APP)_COLD.bin` automatically, and the main binary
shrinks by exactly that much. The `org` in a separate module DOES apply to
a section another module contributes to.

### A bank

```
zcc ... -o bank3.o bank3.c --codesegBANK_3 --constsegBANK_3 --datasegBANK_3 -c
```

Produces `$(APP)_BANK_3.bin` and a map entry at `$3C000` — the address
encoding is `(bank << 16) | addr`. This is the correct mechanism; hand-rolled
`SECTION CODE_1` also links but is not the documented route.

## Assembling the tap

`tools/mktap.py` writes the loader and one headed CODE block per binary:

```
python3 tools/mktap.py out.tap --clear 24575 --usr 32768 \
    --code 0x6000 assets_low.bin \
    --code 0x6500 logic.bin \
    --code 0x8000 program
```

Every block gets a **real header**, so a plain `LOAD ""CODE` reads each in
turn — which is what makes it work on a 48K, where nothing can page.

Blocks load in the order given. Addresses are written by hand while their
SIZES come from the build, so one growing into the next is a matter of
when, not whether: mktap refuses overlaps, blocks at or below `CLEAR`, and
anything that runs into the stack.

## The loading screen

A loading screen is **not an asset**. It is shown once while the tape runs
and then thrown away, so it wants none of the machinery the game's graphics
need:

| | |
|---|---|
| **not compressed** | the ROM's `LOAD` writes it; there is nobody to decompress it |
| **not in the program** | it costs zero bytes of `0x8000-0xBFFF`, the scarce region |
| **not referenced by any code** | no header, no `extern`, no blit |
| **first block on the tape** | so the screen stops being blank seconds in |
| **overwritten freely** | the game paints over it whenever it likes |

Aim raw blocks straight at the display file and the ROM paints it for you:

```
--splash 0x5000 logo_pix.bin      # 2048 bytes: bitmap, character rows 16-23
--splash 0x5A00 logo_att.bin      #  256 bytes: their attributes
```

This project first did the opposite — a ZX0 blob compiled in and a
`render_logo()` that decompressed and blitted it. **530 bytes of the
tightest region in the machine** for a picture overwritten seconds later.
Moving it to the tape gave all of it back.

### Silencing the loader — POKE 23739,111

**The ROM announces every block, and once the print position runs out of
screen it SCROLLS. That takes the loading screen with it.**

```
POKE 23739,111
```

`23739` is the low byte of the **output routine address for channel "S"**
(the main screen) in the channel block at `CHANS` (23734). It normally
points at `PRINT-OUT`; `111` points it at a `RET`, so everything the ROM
prints is discarded. Verified on 48K and 128K.

Do this **before the first `LOAD`**, and understand what it is not:

* `PAPER 0: INK 0: CLS` **hides** the messages. It cannot stop them
  scrolling. Black on black still moves the picture up the screen.
* Counting lines is not enough either. Fourteen messages "fit" in the
  22 available — and the screen still scrolled, because the print position
  starts wherever the ROM left it, not at the top.

The symptom is a loading screen that appears and then silently vanishes
before the program starts. It reads as "something clears the display", and
the bank staging is the obvious suspect and the wrong one.

**The cost: a tape error is silent too.** If loading fails mysteriously on
real hardware, comment the poke out first.

### Where in the screen it can live

If blobs stage through the display file (see *Loading into a bank*), the
loading screen has to sit where they do not land:

* A 2519-byte blob at `0x4000` covers `0x4000-0x49D7`: the whole top third
  plus the first two pixel lines of the middle one.
* **The bottom third, `0x5000-0x57FF`, is never touched** — character rows
  16-23, attributes at `0x5A00`.

A third's pixel lines are 256 bytes apart, so three character rows are
**not contiguous**: ship the whole 2048-byte third with the picture placed
inside it rather than trying to address rows individually.

### The display file is exempt from the CLEAR check

`mktap` refuses blocks at or below `CLEAR` because BASIC would overwrite
them. `0x4000-0x5AFF` is the exception: BASIC keeps no variables in the
screen, so a block aimed there is a picture, not a mistake.

### It doubles as the splash screen, for free

If the music first-side blocks until a key — Tritone's does — then playing a
tune after the load *is* the "press any key" wait, with the loading screen
still on display. No new state, no input loop:

```c
load_tiles();
load_map();
splash();               /* the tune blocks until a key, logo still up */
enter_state(ST_TITLE);
```

The tune then starts the moment loading finishes instead of when the title
appears, and covers the asset decompression too.

## What appmake will not do

**`org` in a user module: placed, then DROPPED.** z80asm honours it —
`__ORGPROBE_head = $7D00`, symbol at `$7D00` — and `-create-app` then
discards the bytes. The tap comes out byte-for-byte the size it was
without the section. C reading that array gets zeros.

**A bank section: shipped, but HEADERLESS.** `SECTION CODE_1` reaches the
tap (16471 -> 17499 bytes) as a block with no header. `LOAD ""CODE` cannot
read one, and the generated loader would not try. appmake emits banked
blocks for a program that loads its own banks at runtime; the upstream
z88dk example sidesteps this entirely by shipping a `.sna`.

**Parse the tap. Do not trust its size.** The size said the bytes shipped;
only dumping the block headers showed nothing would load them:

```python
d = open('out.tap','rb').read(); i = 0
while i < len(d):
    ln = int.from_bytes(d[i:i+2],'little'); i += 2
    b = d[i:i+ln]; i += ln
    if b[0] == 0 and len(b) >= 19:
        print('HEADER', {0:'BASIC',3:'CODE'}.get(b[1],'?'),
              'len', int.from_bytes(b[12:14],'little'),
              'addr 0x%04X' % int.from_bytes(b[14:16],'little'))
    else:
        print('  data', len(b)-2)          # <-- headerless: nothing loads it
```

## Loading into a bank

**This works and ships.** `assets/action-force.scr` -- 6912 bytes, 2519
ZX0'd, which fits nowhere in addressable memory -- rides in bank 1 and is
decompressed to the screen when the cutscene state opens.

### BASIC loads, YOUR code pages

BASIC must never write `0x7FFD`. Three attempts to make it do so failed,
and the first failed while looking perfect: it booted, rendered, and had
the data in the wrong bank.

```
LOAD ""CODE            the copier, above RAMTOP
LOAD ""CODE            the blob, into the SCREEN at 0x4000
POKE  bank, length, destination
RANDOMIZE USR          the copier: pages, copies, pages back
LOAD ""CODE  x3        the program
RANDOMIZE USR          go
```

Bit 4 of `0x7FFD` is the ROM select and bit 5 the paging lock: BASIC's
`OUT` swaps a ROM under a running interpreter, and its failure to update
BANKM lets the ROM undo the switch mid-`LOAD`. Machine code with `di` and
BANKM handled properly has none of those problems.

### Stage through the screen, bank phase first

The display file is the only free 6912 bytes on the machine, and ordering
the bank phase before every other block means there is nothing in memory
for the staging to land on. The load shows as noise, which is honest.

### Where the stub lives: above RAMTOP, nowhere else

| address | what happens |
|---|---|
| `0x5AFA` | tail of the ATTRIBUTE FILE. The ROM writes to the screen while loading and wipes the parameters. Dead boot. |
| `0x5B00` | the printer buffer **on a 48K**. On a 128K it is the machine's own system variables -- BANKM is at `0x5B5C`. Crash. |
| `0x5F00` | above `CLEAR 24319`. **Correct.** Nothing else has a claim above RAMTOP; that is what CLEAR is for. |

"Traditional home for a loader stub" is 48K advice. Check it against the
128K map first.

### Preserve BANKM, do not force it

```asm
ld  a, (0x5B5C)         ; whatever the ROM had
ld  (_bc_save), a
and 0xF8                ; keep ROM select, screen, and the LOCK
or  b                   ; only the bank bits change
```

Forcing a value assumes the machine arrived with bank 0, the 48K ROM and
nothing else set. If the lock was on, the `OUT` is silently ignored and
the copy lands in bank 0 looking successful.

### Do NOT load at offset 0

`hw_detect()` proves a machine is a 128K by writing to **bank 1 at
0xC000** and reading it back through another bank. A payload at offset 0
is scratch by the time anything looks for it. Use the copier's
destination: this project loads at `BANK_DEST = 0x0100`.

### Reading it back

Paging evicts the whole `0xC000` window -- shadow screen, every buffer.
That is survivable only where nothing in that window is touched between
the two `OUT`s. The cutscene qualifies: no board is being drawn, the
decompressor's code is at `0x8000`, its workspace is on the stack below,
and the destination is the screen at `0x4000`. Interrupts off across it.

## The tests that lied, and what they cost

Nine rounds. **Three real bugs** (two stub addresses, the `hw_detect`
collision) and **three self-inflicted**, each of which looked exactly like
a banking failure:

**A hand-typed address.** Five consecutive taps failed with the game
returning instantly to BASIC because the invocation said `--code 0x6800`
for the COLD block where the build computes `0x6600` from
`logic_org.addr`. Nothing about banking was wrong in any of them. **Put
`--bank` in the Makefile next to the other blocks** -- generated
addresses must come from the generated file.

**A probe without `volatile`.** The scan wrote a bank number and read a
byte back around an `__asm` block, both plain globals. At `-SO3
--opt-code-speed` the compiler deferred the store and cached the load, so
the probe paged somewhere nobody asked for and compared a stale value. It
reported NOWHERE while the copy had been landing correctly the whole time.
**Anything an `__asm` block reads or writes must be `volatile`.**

**A probe hunting the wrong byte.** After the sentinel was replaced with
the real payload the check still looked for `0xA5`, so a perfectly good
bank reported NOWHERE.

The lesson is not "write better probes". It is that **a probe is code and
can be wrong**, and an instrument that has never returned a positive has
not been shown to work. Ours never had. Prefer a test whose success is
visible -- a picture that draws -- over one byte that has to survive the
whole boot to be believed.

**A test must never press a key while the tape loads.** The ROM's loader
watches for BREAK, so a harness that presses SPACE in a loop to get past a
splash screen aborts the load — every run "fails to reach the title" with a
perfectly good tap. Wait passively for the load, and only then press
anything.

## The loader is a program, and its SIZE matters

The BASIC loader grows upward from `PROG` (~23755) into `CLEAR`, which
leaves it only a few hundred bytes. **A loader whose size grows with the
content is the bug.**

At one `LOAD` / five `POKE`s / one `USR` per bank block, ten cutscene
screens made a **1472-byte** BASIC program — past RAMTOP at `0x5EFF`, over
the bank copier at `0x5F00` and into the assets at `0x6000`. Every block
loaded and the game never started.

The fix is a self-advancing copier walking a table appended to its own
block, driven by one line:

```
FOR I=1 TO n: LOAD ""CODE: RANDOMIZE USR e: NEXT I
```

**117 bytes, and it does not grow when screens are added.** Check the BASIC
size whenever a block is added:

```python
d = open('out.tap','rb').read()
ln = int.from_bytes(d[0:2],'little')            # skip the BASIC header
ln = int.from_bytes(d[2+ln:4+ln],'little')
print('BASIC %d bytes, ends 0x%04X' % (ln-2, 23755+ln-2))
```

## The tape is a cost too

Blocks are raw on tape: ten 2519-byte cutscene screens plus a 2304-byte
loading screen took the tap from 24 KB to **51 KB**, about 33 seconds of
loading. Two consequences worth planning for:

* Test harnesses time out. `render_paths` needed 30s -> 60s, and
  `pixel_hash` was outgrown twice.
* **`--accelerate-loading` IS safe on a 128K.** A comment in this project
  claimed it was not — that the load silently never completed. Re-tested
  with the same tap on the same machine, with and without: both reach the
  title and both read page-7 attr `0x45`. It cut `render_paths` from 121s
  to 22s. Whatever was originally seen, it was not the flag.

## Checklist for a new block

1. Emit it — standalone `.asm`, `#pragma codeseg`, or `--constsegBANK_n`.
2. Add it to `mktap.py` with an explicit address.
3. **Parse the tap** and confirm a HEADER, not a bare data block.
4. Check `mktap`'s free-space line and `checkmem`'s ceiling.
5. **Check the BASIC loader still fits under `CLEAR`.**
6. Read the bytes back on a real load — 48K, 128K **and +3**.
7. Bump any test timeout that waits for the title; the tape just got longer.
8. Only then write code that depends on it.

## Before reaching for a custom loader

A machine-code tape loader is the usual answer to "no messages, logo
throughout" — and it is a rewrite of the one path whose failures are all
silent. **Try the cheap things first:**

| want | cost |
|---|---|
| no messages, no scrolling | `POKE 23739,111` — one BASIC line |
| picture up early | make it the first block |
| picture costs no memory | aim it at the display file |
| blank name in the messages | `--name ' '`; `LOAD ""` matches anything |
| nothing visible while staging | `BORDER 0: PAPER 0: INK 0: CLS` |

All five together give what a custom loader is normally written for, and
none of them touches the loading path's structure.
