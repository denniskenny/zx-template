# ZX Memory: where things go, and what breaks if they go elsewhere

Run **`make memmap`** first. It prints both halves of the layout together —
the linker's and the hand-placed one — and neither is visible from the other:

```
  linker-placed (code, rodata, data, bss)
    8000 .. BB64   15204 bytes   top symbol _ppx_src
    BB64 .. C000    1180 bytes   FREE before the 0xC000 limit

  hand-placed (include/memmap.h)
    C000 .. D000    4096 bytes   MEM_VBUF
    ...
    DC48 .. FFFF    9144 bytes   FREE to the top of RAM
```

`make map` runs `tools/checkmem.py`, which **fails the build** if the
linker-placed part reaches 0xC000. That is not a style rule; see § Banking.

## The map, and who owns each part

| Range | What | Ours? |
|-------|------|-------|
| `0000-3FFF` | ROM | No — and *which* ROM is switchable, see § The ROM trap |
| `4000-57FF` | Screen pixels | Yes, via `gfx.c` |
| `5800-5AFF` | Screen attributes | Yes |
| `5B00-5BFF` | Printer buffer | Scratch, usable |
| `5C00-5CBF` | BASIC system variables | **No** |
| `5CC0-RAMTOP` | BASIC program, variables, calculator stack | **No** |
| ~`7FA0` | The machine stack, growing down from RAMTOP | **No** |
| `8000-BFFF` | Our code, rodata, data, bss (`-zorg=32768`) | Yes |
| `C000-FFFF` | Our hand-placed buffers — **and a paged bank on 128K** | Carefully |

**`0x6000-0x7FFF` looks free and is not.** The tap's loader does
`CLEAR 32767`, so RAMTOP is `0x7FFF` and everything from `~0x5CC0` up to the
stack belongs to BASIC. Putting 7 KB of buffers there survived on a 48K and a
128K by luck and was a prime suspect in a +3 crash. If you want that region,
lower the loader's `CLEAR` so BASIC never claims it — do not just move in.

## Contended vs uncontended

The ULA steals cycles from `4000-7FFF` while it is drawing the display.
Everywhere else runs full speed.

- **Code must live at `0x8000+`.** `-zorg=32768` is chosen for this, and the
  Makefile says so: the floating bus sync loops in `src/vsync.c` are timed and
  drift if the code fetching them is contended.
- **Data can be contended if it is only touched in the vblank window**, when
  the ULA is not drawing and contention does not apply. That is the argument
  that made `0x6000` look attractive — it was right about contention and wrong
  about ownership.
- On a 128K, contention follows the *bank*, not the address: banks 1, 3, 5, 7
  are contended wherever they are paged. Bank 0 at `0xC000` is not.

## Banking

`0xC000-0xFFFF` is a window onto one of eight RAM banks on a 128K-class
machine, selected by bits 0-2 of port **`0x7FFD`**. Whatever the linker puts
there vanishes when something pages, and the symptom is silent corruption
rather than a crash — which is why `checkmem` refuses to let it happen.

Our buffers live up there deliberately and are safe **only because bank 0 is
selected and then left alone**: `hw_detect()` ends by selecting it, and
`main()` locks paging (bit 5) on machines that do not need the +2A/+3 floating
bus. If anything ever pages again, those buffers move first.

### The ROM trap — read this before writing 0x7FFD

Port `0x7FFD` is write-only and does four things at once:

| Bits | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0-2 | RAM bank at `0xC000` |
| 3 | Display file: 0 = page 5, 1 = page 7 (the shadow screen) |
| **4** | **ROM select** |
| 5 | **Lock** — once set, every later write is ignored, silently |

Mirror whatever you write into BANKM at `0x5B5C`; see below.

**Update BANKM every time you write this port.** `0x7FFD` is write-only, so
the ROM keeps its own copy of the last value at the system variable **BANKM
(`0x5B5C`)** and writes that copy back whenever it touches paging — the
interrupt handler included. Leave it stale and the ROM undoes you, typically
within a frame:

```asm
    ld  bc, #0x7FFD
    ld  a, (_page_reg)
    out (c), a
    ld  (0x5B5C), a     ; BANKM — not optional
```

Skipping it made the shadow screen appear never to display on a +2A/+3: bit 3
was set on the port, the ROM restored its own value before the ULA read the
new screen, and every state composed into page 7 came up blank while the ones
composed into page 5 looked fine. **A 128K tolerated it**, so the test suite
was green throughout.

**Preserve bit 4 unless you mean to change the ROM.** On a 128K it picks the
128 editor (0) or 48K BASIC (1). On a +2A/+3 the ROM number is *two* bits —
`0x1FFD` bit 2 above `0x7FFD` bit 4 — and a 48K-format tap loads from 48
BASIC, which is **ROM 3**. Clearing bit 4 drops it to **ROM 2: +3DOS**.

Two things then break, and they look unrelated:

- `print_at()` reads the character set from `0x3D00`, which only 48K BASIC
  has. Text renders as noise, correctly positioned and coloured.
- IM 1 interrupts vector to `0x0038` in whatever ROM is paged. In +3DOS that
  is not a BASIC interrupt handler, and the machine ends up back in BASIC with
  **"Nonsense in BASIC"**.

So: **`di` around any paging sequence**, and keep bit 4 set. `hw_detect()` did
neither and crashed every +3 while passing every test on 48K and 128K. Its
`0x11 / 0x12 / 0x10` constants are that shape on purpose. Fixing it also made
128K floating-bus detection start working, because interrupts had been landing
inside `vsync_detect()`'s timed probe.

Port `0x1FFD` is decoded on a +2A/+3 only, and **partially decodes onto
`0x7FFD` on a plain 128K** — writing it there repages RAM. Guard any `0x1FFD`
write behind a genuine +2A/+3 test.

## The +2A/+3, specifically

Three faults this project hit are +3-only, and every one passed a full 48K and
128K test run first. If you change anything about paging, the ROM, or where
buffers live, **that machine is the one that decides**.

- **Do not keep anything above `0xC000`.** It is a paged bank, and on a +3 the
  ROM pages it for the RAM disk and +3DOS workspace whenever it likes.
  Buffers there are not corrupted at once — they rot between writes, which
  looks like a rendering bug, not a memory bug. The buffers moved to `0x6000`
  for exactly this reason, and that freed page 7 for the shadow screen as a
  bonus.
- **Page 7 is not spare RAM.** It is 16 KB and the shadow screen only uses
  6 912 bytes of it. Putting buffers in the remainder is arithmetically sound,
  works on a 128K, and gives a +3 part-garbage tiles and no title screen.
- **The ROM number is two bits** — `0x1FFD` bit 2 above `0x7FFD` bit 4 — so a
  write that is ROM-neutral on a 128K may not be on a +3. A 48K-format tap
  loads from 48 BASIC, ROM 3; clearing bit 4 lands on ROM 2, +3DOS.
- **A +3 is not reliably detectable.** `vsync_mode == VSYNC_MODE_128K` finds
  one only when the mode-2 floating bus was detected; a +3 that falls back to
  HALT is indistinguishable from a 128K by anything this program knows. Port
  `0x1FFD` is decoded there and not on a 128K, so probing it is the obvious
  route if a real test is ever needed.

**A snapshot will not test any of this.** `.sna`/`.z80` restore a machine
mid-flight and skip the boot path entirely — the ROM state the loader leaves,
`hw_detect()`, the first paging write. All three faults above lived there.
Testing a +3 means driving its boot menu and loading the tape for real.

## Reclaiming space you did not know you were spending

**Ask who *references* the thing, not which compiler switch removes it.**
z88dk's zx console keeps a pointer to a 4x8 font, and `console_vars.asm` does

```asm
    EXTERN  CRT_FONT_64
```

purely to store that address in a two-byte variable. The EXTERN alone makes
the linker load **768 bytes** of glyph data into a program that never prints
through the console. No `-startup=` value and no `CRT_ENABLE_STDIO=0` removes
it; hours went into looking for a switch that does not exist.

The fix is to satisfy the reference yourself. `src/no_font64.asm`:

```asm
    MODULE  no_font64
    PUBLIC  CRT_FONT_64
    defc    CRT_FONT_64 = 0x3D00    ; the ROM's own character set
```

Nothing is unresolved, the module is never loaded, and the pointer still aims
somewhere valid. **768 bytes, zero cost.** The same trick applies to anything
the crt drags in by name.

Other things measured on this project, so nobody re-derives them:

| | bytes |
|---|---|
| ZX0 decompressor (one copy — there is no duplication) | **75** |
| Every string literal in the program, padding included | **~716** |
| `DEBUG_STATE_WALK` debug keys | **99** |
| The unused 4x8 font | **768** |

**Pad at the point of use, not in the literal.** Every hint message here was
written out to 31 characters by hand so the next would erase the last. One
`hint_row()` that pads to width recovered ~112 bytes across nine strings.

### Measuring: the trap

Sizes derived from a link map are *gap to the next symbol*, which **wildly
overstates the last symbol before any unmapped library code**. On this project
that made the ZX0 decompressor look like 1 414 bytes (it is 75) and the string
pool look like 2 324 (it is 716). Both were reported as findings before being
checked. **Per-module and per-section totals are trustworthy; individual symbol
sizes are an upper bound.** `__*_size` symbols in the map hold real section
sizes as their *value* — use those.

## zcc will not evaluate `#if` inside a function containing `__asm`

**It also drops `#if` and `#define` that appear AFTER such a function, in
the same file.** A guard written below an `__asm` function compiled to
nothing, and the error was `undefined identifier` pointing at a line
*inside* the guard — which reads as the preprocessor working and the
symbol missing. Put every conditional above the first `__asm`, or use a
`const` pointer instead of a `#define`.


Preprocessor directives in the body of a function that has an inline asm
block are **passed through to the back end verbatim, unevaluated**. This is
not a warning; it is silent.

```c
int main(void) {
    __asm
    ld bc, #0x7FFD
    ...
    __endasm;

#if !BUILD_SHADOW          /* NOT evaluated.  Reaches the back end as text. */
    probe();               /* stays live in every build */
#endif
}
```

That cost a session. A function was excluded from `SRCS` for one target and
its only call site gated with `#if` in `main()` — which has an asm block — so
the call survived and the link failed with `undefined symbol` from source that
plainly excluded it. Every re-read of the source confirmed it was correct.
`zcc -E` output is what settles it: the `#if` is still there in the `.i` file.

The same mechanism explains **`syntax error: token -> '/'`** on an ordinary
comment following `__endasm;`, and a spurious `syntax error: token ->
'__endasm'` when a second asm block appears later in the same function.

**The breakage is per-function, not per-file.** `#if` works normally in an
asm-free function in a file whose other functions use asm — which is the
escape route: put the conditional in an asm-free function, or select the
implementation in the **Makefile** via a source-list variable and leave the
call site unconditional.

**Also: an empty function is not free.** Where headroom is measured in bytes,
an empty gated stub still costs its `call` and `ret`. Putting the gated call
inside a branch that is *already* compiled out for that target costs zero,
which is the only version that fits a build with five bytes spare.

## The address-space ceiling, and how to get it back

On a 128K-class machine the shadow screen lives in page 7, which can only be
addressed at `0xC000`. Bank it in at startup and leave it there — the obvious
implementation — and **all code must fit below 0xC000: a hard 16 KB ceiling**,
regardless of how much RAM the machine has. That is an *address space* limit,
not a memory one, and it is the single biggest constraint on this program.

**Page 7 only has to be mapped while you copy into it.** With interrupts off,
page it in, copy from a buffer that lives below 0xC000, page bank 0 back. Code
above 0xC000 is invisible for the duration and intact either side, so it can
run to 0xFFFF *and* the machine keeps its shadow screen. Requirements: the copy
routine and its source below 0xC000, the stack below 0xC000, `di`/`ei` around
the window, and nothing above 0xC000 touched inside it. See `docs/PLAN.md` P8.

### This is measured, not assumed

`src/pageprobe.c` writes a sentinel at 0xFF00, banks page 7 in at 0xC000,
writes to 0xC000 and 0xDAFF, banks bank 0 back, and rereads the sentinel. It
reports on the title screen as `PAGEWIN`, because a +3 can only be asked that
way.

| | |
|---|---|
| **48K** | `N/A` — nothing pages |
| **128K** (ZEsarUX) | **SURVIVES** |
| **+3** (Fuse, real load) | **SURVIVES** |

The +3 result is the one that counts: it has a second paging port at 0x1FFD, a
different memory controller, and every fault this project has had in that
window came from it. Two of those survived a green test suite.

The probe is also **its own witness** — `page_probe` links at 0xC0A7, inside
the window being paged away, and still holds the right value afterwards. That
is stronger than the sentinel alone, and it was luck rather than design; if you
write a probe like this, put a variable up there deliberately.

Two details that are not optional:

- **Store the result after banking back**, not during the window. Writing to a
  variable that lives above 0xC000 while page 7 is mapped puts it in the
  screen, not in your bss.
- **BANKM (0x5B5C) on every write, both directions.** Verified as 0x10 after
  the probe. Leave it stale and the ROM's interrupt handler writes its copy
  back over you — that cost most of a session once already.

The probe lives in the **48k build only**, which is the point rather than a
limitation: that build is the one with code and bss above 0xC000, so it is the
only one whose survival means anything. The 128k build has nothing up there to
lose.

## One binary for 48K and 128K

The obvious plan is to detect the machine and choose a layout. **You cannot:
code placement is fixed at link time**, long before any detection runs. A
binary with code above 0xC000 can never bank page 7 there.

The tempting escape is to map page 7 only while copying into it, so code can
live to 0xFFFF *and* a 128K keep its shadow screen. **The hardware permits
this** — measured, see above — **but a renderer that draws directly into the
shadow screen does not.** If `gfx_target()` aims at 0xC000 and then chrome,
text, cursor and dirty cells all write there, page 7 must stay mapped across
arbitrary game code, which is precisely what forbids code above 0xC000.
Confining it to a copy means composing a whole 6912-byte screen low first, and
that space does not exist.

**Check who writes to 0xC000 before designing around the window.** A session
went into a plan that did not survive contact with one `#define`.

### What works instead

**If all code is below 0xC000 anyway, page 7 can simply stay mapped, and no
window is needed.** The single binary is then the 128K build, running on
everything:

- The `shadow_ok = 0` fallback — written for 128Ks whose paging is locked —
  **is** the 48K path. Verified: the 128k tap runs correctly under ZEsarUX
  `--machine 48k`.
- Reserve `0xDB00-0xFFFF` as the data region on *both* machines: real RAM on a
  48K, page-7 RAM on a 128K, same addresses, no conditional accessors.
- `0xC000-0xDAFF` is the shadow screen on a 128K and spare on a 48K.

Measure before assuming the 48K build needs its extra 16 KB. On this project
it exceeded the 16 KB ceiling by **167 bytes** while leaving 16 217 clear — the
address space it paid the shadow screen for was almost entirely unused.

## Lowering -zorg: 8 KB of code space, at 50%% of the speed

Code at 0x8000 leaves 16 KB below the 0xC000 ceiling.  Moving the
hand-placed buffers up to 0xDB00 and setting `-zorg=24576` puts code at
0x6000 instead: **5 bytes clear became 8197**.

Two beliefs were tested and both turned out wrong in opposite directions.

**The floating bus does NOT need non-contended code.** The Makefile
asserted for a long time that -zorg=0x8000 was required for stable sync.
Measured: vsync still settles on 0x40FF and the marker still lands on the
displayed screen, on 48K and 128K alike.

**But contention is expensive.** 0x6000-0x7FFF is contended, the ULA
steals cycles from every fetch there, and half the program now lives in
it: the state walk went from 19.7-21.1s to **30.4s**.  Functionally
perfect, materially slower.

So the trade is 8 KB against roughly half the speed, and the interesting
version is selective: put only COLD code low — AI, pathfinding, anything
run once a turn rather than once a frame — and keep the render path at
0x8000.  Per-module placement, not a global -zorg.

The layout itself is safe on all three machines (`tests/lowmem.tap`,
border green): stack lands at 0x5FA4, below the new code base, and
0xDB00-0xFFFF round-trips every byte.  Worth confirming rather than
assuming, because a +3 had crashed on that region before.

## Getting data to an address is a separate problem

Placing something correctly and it ARRIVING there are different things,
and the gap between them has cost this project three investigations. A
section can link perfectly and ship nothing; a bank block can reach the
tap with no header and never be loaded; a boot can render perfectly with
the data absent.

**See `.devin/skills/zx-loader`** for the whole of it: emitting a block,
the appmake behaviours that drop one silently, loading into a bank at all,
and how to prove the bytes arrived.

The one rule worth repeating here, because it is a memory-map decision
rather than a loader one: **bank things you SWAP, keep things you
ALTERNATE.** A bank is storage, not addressable memory -- reading one
evicts every buffer at 0xC000 -- so it suits data needed one at a time
(a level, a tune, an alternate tileset, decompressed into a buffer that
already exists) and not data needed alongside other data (a second
animation frame, which must be live at the same time as the first).

## 0x6000-0x7FFF is not free: MEM_VBUF lives there (or did)

The 8 KB below the program looks like the obvious home for compressed
assets. It is only free if nothing else is in it, and on this project the
hand-placed buffers were: `MEM_VBUF` and friends ran 0x6000-0x7CAA.

Loading an asset block at 0x6000 on top of them produced a bug worth
knowing the shape of:

- **The sheet blobs worked.** They are decompressed once at boot, before
  the renderer first writes VBUF, so they are consumed before being
  clobbered. Working *by luck*.
- **The per-level blobs did not.** Decompressed on every level load, long
  after VBUF is in use, so they were read back out of render scratch.

**`render_paths.py` passed the whole time.** It exercises one level, at
boot. Only `p0_state_walk`, which walks ten, caught it — and it presented
as "a new game restarts at level 0", nothing resembling a memory clash.

The fix is to put the buffers at **0xDB00**: page 7 above the shadow screen
on a 128K, plain RAM on a 48K, same addresses on both, and everything in
them is written at runtime so nothing has to be loaded there.
`tools/mkassets.py` now reads MEM_VBUF out of memmap.h and refuses to build
an overlapping block.

**Two general lessons.** Free space below the program is only free if you
check what is hand-placed there — the linker map will not tell you, because
it does not know about `memmap.h`. And an asset used *once at boot* can
hide a placement bug that an asset used *per level* exposes; if graphics
survive the title screen, that is not evidence they are safely placed.

## Compressing music (or any large read-mostly data)

**Song data is the most compressible thing in a game and it starts in the
worst place.** Measured on this project's two Tritone tunes:

| | assembled | ZX0 | |
|---|---|---|---|
| a 13-bar march | 513 | **190** | 63% |
| a 7-bar shanty  | 264 | **123** | 53% |
| | 777 | 313 | **~430 bytes** |

Patterns repeat and half of every row is a `$01` sustain byte. Those bytes
come out of `0x8000-0xBFFF`, the only region that can hold code, which
makes them the most valuable bytes in the machine.

### The trap: the order table is ABSOLUTE POINTERS

A Tritone song begins with `DEFW PAT0, DEFW PAT1, ...` — addresses the
LINKER resolves. **Compress the module's bytes, unpack them anywhere else,
and every pointer is wrong by the relocation distance.** The symptom is
the right tempo, the wrong notes, and a crash a bar or two in when the
engine follows a pointer into whatever follows.

Any format with internal pointers behaves this way. Check for them before
relocating data.

### The fix: assemble at the destination

Give the song data `org MEM_MUSIC`, assemble it, and compress **that
image**. The labels then resolve to the buffer the game unpacks into, so
the pointers are correct on arrival. Same idea as `SECTION COLD`.

```
compressed blob    0x8000-0xBFFF   DEFB in the tune's linkable .asm
unpacked image     above MEM_END   one buffer, sized for the largest tune
the engine         0x8000-0xBFFF   ONE copy, shared by every tune
```

* **The blob stays low**: small, and the tape can address it.
* **The image goes above `MEM_END`** — uncontended, and the region code can
  never use because a 128K pages it. Works on both machines: plain RAM on
  a 48K, page 7 on a 128K, which is mapped throughout play.
* **ONE buffer**, because tunes block: only one is ever live. A second
  would cost bytes to state what the control flow guarantees.
* **Not a bank**: 128K only, and a 48K needs the tune too.

The destination must exist in exactly one place. Here `memmap.h` owns it
and the Makefile reads it back, so moving it rebuilds the tunes:

```make
MUSIC_ORG = $(shell $(PYTHON) tools/checkmem.py --addr MEM_MUSIC)
```

### Verify it in the build, not by ear

This shipped broken once because nothing checked. A first extractor
scraped `$xx` literals out of the .asm and **silently skipped every
`DEFW <label>`** — so the order table vanished. It recovered 485 bytes
from a 513-byte song, and that 28-byte discrepancy was printed and read
past.

Three checks, all cheap, all in the build:

1. **Round trip.** Decompress the blob with `z88dk-dzx0` and compare with
   the assembled `.bin`. Fail the build if they differ.
2. **Every pointer in range** — not just the first. A bad LOOP pointer at
   the end is a crash rather than wrong notes.
3. **Read it back on the machine.** After the tune has played, compare
   `MEM_MUSIC` against the assembled reference over ZRCP. That is the only
   check that proves the whole chain.

None of these can hear the tune. They prove the engine reads what the
arranger wrote; pitch and tempo still need a person.

### It pays twice

At 530 bytes of raw pattern the debug build could not afford both tunes
and linked one, so it played different music from the shipping build —
a debug build testing something else. Compressed, the divergence stopped
being worth having and a conditional came out of three files.

## Adding a graphic

The converters do the work; see `.devin/skills/zx-tiles`. What this skill
adds is where the bytes end up.

1. **Compressed source** goes in the binary, below `0xC000`, as rodata from a
   generated header.
2. **Unpacked destination** goes in `include/memmap.h`, above `0xC000`. Add a
   block to the end of the chain — never pick an address:

   ```c
   #define MEM_NEWTHING  (MEM_U_FLAGS + 40)
   #define MEM_END       (MEM_NEWTHING + 512)
   ```

   Every block is sized from the thing that lives in it and `MEM_END` is
   checked against `0x10000`.
3. `make memmap` to confirm it landed where you meant.

If `checkmem` fails, the fix is to move *data* into `memmap.h`, not to raise
the limit. But check what is actually big first — `make memmap` reports per
region, and the squeeze is usually code.

## Linking: generated headers must not be duplicated

A generated header that defines `static const uint8_t foo[] = {...}` puts a
**copy in every .c file that includes it**. Three copies of a 380-byte tile
sheet cost 760 wasted bytes and show up nowhere but the link map.

`tools/tmx2header.py` and `tools/zxp_tiles_zx0.py` emit this instead:

```c
#ifndef TILES_VIEW_DEFINE_DATA
extern const uint8_t tiles_view_zx0[380];
#else
const uint8_t tiles_view_zx0[380] = { ... };
#endif
```

Exactly one translation sprite claims each header:

```c
#define TILES_VIEW_DEFINE_DATA      /* BEFORE every #include */
#include "../include/tiles_view.h"
```

- **The claim must precede every include**, not just the direct one.
  `board.h` reaches `map_1.h`; a claim made after that arrives too late and
  nobody defines the data.
- `extern const x[36] = {...}` is **still a definition** — the initialiser is
  what matters, not the keyword. The guard has to wrap the whole array.
- Failure modes are both link errors, which is the point: *undefined symbol*
  means nobody claimed it, *duplicate symbol* means two files did.

Current owners: `src/render.c` takes the tile sheets and level 1; `src/cold.c`
takes campaign maps 2-10.

The same trap applies to any header pulling in a generated one for its *size
macros* — the data comes along. `include/memmap.h` and `include/render.h` both
carry a note about it; `render.h` was carrying three copies of the tile sheets
purely to reach `TILES_VIEW_TILE_W`.

## Inline assembly and addresses

Inline assembly cannot see C expressions, so any `memmap.h` address used in
`__asm` has to be a literal. Guard it:

```c
#if MEM_VBUF != 0xC000
#error "present_pixels() has MEM_VBUF baked into its assembly"
#endif
```

SDCC's assembler rejects `.rept`/`.endm` and the `0 (iy)` indexed operand
form. Copy the shape of `border()` in `src/gfx.c` rather than re-deriving it.

## Verifying

```bash
make memmap                 # both halves of the layout, and the free space
make map                    # build + checkmem (fails if the linker crosses 0xC000)
python3 tools/checkmem.py zxgame.map --layout
```

Per-symbol sizes derived from a link map are *gap to the next symbol* and
overstate the last symbol before any library code. Per-module totals are
trustworthy; individual symbols are an upper bound.

**A green test run says nothing about a machine the tests cannot load.** The
+3 fault above survived a fully passing suite on 48K and 128K for a whole
session, and three confident diagnoses were wrong before the real one. If a
bug is model-specific, reproduce it on that model before theorising.
